    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds cubed lamb stew meat</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 large Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored, and cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Place the flour in a plastic bag; season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the lamb, and shake until
            evenly coated with flour. Melt half of the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the lamb in batches until
            golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch; set aside. </li>
        <li> Reduce heat to medium and add the remaining butter. Stir in the onions, and cook until the onions have
            softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar, curry powder, apples, chicken stock, raisins,
            and browned lamb. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until
            the lamb is very tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the lemon juice and cook 2 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
